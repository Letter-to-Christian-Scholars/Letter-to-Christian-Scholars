## **Central Question:**

Was Josephus a contemporary of Jesus and if so did he say anything interesting about Jesus?


## **Why this is important to me:**

Even non-Christians believe that Jesus existed on this earth. The main reason for this is from the works of Josephus. Josephus references Jesus two times.

If Jesus was truly important, there should be significant information relayed by Josephus. From other sections we have to accept that the 4 Gospels are not important records of Christs works. If that is the case, we must fall on Josephus


## **Josephus wrote 60+ years after Christ's death**

His works are written around 90-100 AD. In fact, Josephus was born in 37 AD which would be after Jesus died.

In other words, Josephuss works cannot be considered 1st person accounts


## **Josephus Talks of Jesus 2 times**

Specifically this is in "Antiquities Book 18" and "Antiquities Book 20"

There is also a discussion of John the Baptist in Book 18. While Jesus is not referenced in this section it is important to note

The extant manuscripts of the book[ Antiquities of the Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquities_of_the_Jews), written by the first-century Jewish historian[ Flavius Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus) around 93â€“94 AD, contain two references to[ Jesus of Nazareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) and one reference to[ John the Baptist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Baptist).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFeldmanHata198754%E2%80%9357-1">[1][2]</a></sup>


## **The most valuable reference of Jesus is a forgery**

The first and most extensive reference to Jesus in the _Antiquities_, found in[ Book 18](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews/Book_XVIII#Chapter_3), states that Jesus was the[ Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah) and a wise teacher who was crucified by[ Pontius Pilate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate). It is commonly called the[ Testimonium Flavianum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus#The_Testimonium_Flavianum).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFeldmanHata198754%E2%80%9357-1">[1][3][4]</a></sup> Almost all modern scholars reject the authenticity of this passage in its present form, while most scholars nevertheless hold that it contains an authentic nucleus referencing the life and execution of Jesus by Pilate, which was then subject to[ Christian interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_interpolation) or alteration.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaier2007336%E2%80%93337-3">[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]</a></sup> However, the exact nature and extent of the Christian redaction remains unclear.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus#cite_note-11">[11][12]</a></sup>


## **The second acknowledges that some called him Christ**

Modern scholarship has largely acknowledged the authenticity of the second reference to Jesus in the _Antiquities_, found in[ Book 20, Chapter 9](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews/Book_XX#Chapter_9). During the time of this writing a couple of the Gospels were being written:

*Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the [sanhedrin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin) of [judges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shophet), and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done*
