#1st Person Accounts of Old Testament Stories


##Central Question:
What can we believe from the Old Testament



##Why this is important to me:

In my mind, to believe in Jesus requires believing the Old Testament. There are many stories that are central to Christianity, the 12 Tribes of Israel, the creation story, and journeys of Moses come to mind first. Also, many of the core Christian tenants are defined in the Old Testament such as the 10 Commandments and tithing

The most important of items established in the Old Testament is the prophecy of a Savior. In my mind it is the key reason to believe in Jesus. He was fulfilling prophecy



##Ancient Manuscript Dating


Dating texts cross-references many techniques to check the results of each. Carbon Dating is one method but not the only method. Experts also look at inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of persons, events, objects, language terms and customs from different time periods

A good example of this is  text handwriting clues such as fonts that did not exist before a time period. The same method is also used for words too. The goal is to narrow down the date by finding features/words that had not been designed before a specific date. 
After a date has been chosen it is peer reviewed for accuracy within their scientific journals

Almost all of them have some parallel to Jonah’s story. The sun myth pictured the descending sun in the west as being swallowed by a monster only to reappear in the east. It was known in Persia and in Egypt. Jonah’s parallel is that he travels west, is swallowed in the west, and returns in the darkness of the fish’s belly to appear in the east. But if this myth had any influence on Jonah’s author, he has changed it completely. Now it takes place in history, with natural creatures in the roles, and testifies to the authority of God’s word and will over creation and human history. | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating\_the\_Bible | [https://stellarhousepublishing.com/jonah-and-the-whale-is-an-ancient-sun-myth/](https://stellarhousepublishing.com/jonah-and-the-whale-is-an-ancient-sun-myth/)                              |
