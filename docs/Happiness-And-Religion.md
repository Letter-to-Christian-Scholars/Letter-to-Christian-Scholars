# **Happiness and Religion**
## **Central Question:**

Why does it seem like the nonreligious nations are more happy


## **Why this is important to me:**

Religion is supposed to bring happiness to people. It is the central reason people want to be religious. I understand that most of this potential happiness is in the after life but many prayers and sermons are spent on the happiness in this life too

If Christians are truly blessed then shouldn't they be more happy?


## **The most happy countries are the least religious**

And the saddest countries are the most religious. Every country with greater than 7.0 happiness are the least religious countries

Russia and China are obvious exceptions in the below maps but their non-religious nature is due to national mandates and authoritarian rule

So any country with the freedom to choose religion meets this fact

As I look at these, I wonder if I can argue that the most religious countries are the least happy. This would be completely opposite of what religious people would expect by their teachings
