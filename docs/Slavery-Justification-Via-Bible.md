## **Central Question:**

How do I explain the very obvious slavery theme in both the Old and New Testaments? A theme that was used for literally centuries to justify slavery


## **Why this is important to me:**

The Bible is supposed to be 'the good book,' the 'book of peace and comfort.' I will be honest, I read the below verses and I cannot believe that we expect kids to read that. Without blinders. Just read through those verses and feel the spirit. Then we praise them for researching the topic. It makes me literally sick.

I am trying to be unbiased in these topics but this is one that I cannot do so. To think that the Bible, Gods Word, was a common source in 1800's pro-slavery literature because of its obvious pro-slavery stance makes me speechless

It makes me wonder what other awful things still exist on this earth because the Bible supports it

## **Summary**

Passages in the New Testament and Old which justify and regulate the institution of slavery have been used as a justification for the keeping of slaves throughout history, and they have also been used as a source of guidance on how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, many Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition.[ George Whitefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whitefield), who is famed for his sparking of the _Great Awakening_ of American evangelicalism, supported as necessary due to the Climate in the[ Province of Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Georgia), for the legalisation of slavery,.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proslavery#cite_note-Cashin-26">[26][27]</a></sup> He believed, as was common at the Time, that each Race had been conditioned by Nature to suit its Environment, and viewed The Negro as suited for Hot Environments. He also believed Georgia's failure to flourish economically was due to a lack of Negroes as were held in other Colonies such as The Carolinas. Thus, Whitfield had altered his position, and partially joined the ranks of the slave owners who he had denounced in his earlier years.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proslavery#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

In both Europe and the United States many Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible.

_[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God ... it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from[ Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis) to[ Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation) ... it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts._

— [Jefferson Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Davis), President,[ Confederate States of America[29][30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America)

_... the right of holding slaves is clearly established in the Holy Scriptures, both by precept and example._

— [Richard Furman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Furman), President,[ South Carolina Baptist Convention[31][32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention#State_conventions)

Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.

[Titus 2:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2%3A9-10&version=ESV)

Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior

[Ephesians 6:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A9&version=ESV)

Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him

[Colossians 3:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A22&version=ESV)

Slaves, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord

[Luke 12:47-48](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+12%3A47-48&version=ESV)

And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating. But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more

[Ephesians 6:5-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A5-8&version=ESV)

Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ, not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free

[1 Corinthians 12:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12%3A13&version=ESV)

There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise

[Luke 12:43-48](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+12%3A43-48&version=ESV)

Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that servant says to himself, ‘My master is delayed in coming,’ and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful. And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating
