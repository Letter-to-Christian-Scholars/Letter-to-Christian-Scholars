### **Central Question:**

How do I believe the New Testament when it contradicts itself


## **Why this is important to me:**

The Bible is the cornerstone of Christianity. The stories inside it have defined the different christian religions. It is supposed to be the word of God. It is hard to believe in such a book when if it contradicts itself a lot

## **Examples of New Testament Contradictions**

In the New Testament, there are contradictions between the genealogies of Jesus given in the first chapter of Matthew and the third chapter of Luke.


### **Which is Joseph's father**

Both genealogies begin with Jesus’ father, who is identified as Joseph (which is curious, given that Mary was supposedly impregnated by the Holy Ghost). But Matthew says Joseph’s father was Jacob, while Luke claims he was Heli. Matthew lists 26 generations between Jesus and King David, whereas Luke records 41. Matthew runs Jesus’ line of descent through David’s son Solomon, while Luke has it going through David’s son Nathan.


### **Which town did the Wise Men See Jesus**

The story of Jesus’ birth is also contradictory. Matthew 2:13-15 depicts Joseph and Mary as fleeing to Egypt with the baby Jesus immediately after the wise men from the east had brought gifts.

But Luke 2:22-40 claims that after the birth of Jesus, his parents remained in Bethlehem for the time of Mary’s purification (which was 40 days, under the Mosaic law). Afterwards, they brought Jesus to Jerusalem “to present him to the Lord,” and then returned to their home in Nazareth. Luke mentions no journey into Egypt or visit by wise men from the east.


### **Two different ending for Judas**

Concerning the death of Judas, the disloyal disciple, Matthew 27:5 states he took the money he had received for betraying Jesus, threw it down in the temple, and “went and hanged himself.” To the contrary, Acts 1:18 claims Judas used the money to purchase a field and “falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.”


### **Did Jesus or Simon Carry the Cross**

In describing Jesus being led to his execution, John 19:17 recounts that he carried his own cross. But Mark 15:21-23 disagrees by saying a man called Simon carried the cross.


### **Which are Jesus's Last Words**

Regarding the last words of Jesus while on the cross, Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34 quote Jesus as crying with a loud voice, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” Luke 23:46 gives his final words as, “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.” John 19:30 alleges the last words were, “It is finished.”


### **Every Resurrection Story is Different**

There are even contradictions in the accounts of the resurrection – the supposed event that is the very foundation of the Christian religion. Mark 16:2 states that on the day of the resurrection, certain women arrived at the tomb at the rising of the sun. But John 20:1 informs us they arrived when it was yet dark. Luke 24:2 describes the tomb as open when the women arrived, whereas Matthew 28:1-2 indicates it was closed. Mark 16:5 declares that the women saw a young man at the tomb, Luke 24:4 says they saw two men, Matthew 28:2 reports they saw an angel, and John 20:11-12 claims they saw two angels.

Also in the resurrection stories, there are contradictions as to the identity of the women who came to the tomb,[7] whether the men or angels the women saw were inside or outside the tomb,[8] whether the men or angels were standing or sitting,[9] and whether Mary Magdalene recognized the risen Jesus when he first appeared to her.[10]

The foregoing examples are just a few of the hundreds of contradictions contained in the Old and New Testaments. Each contradiction is an instance where at least one of the verses is wrong. Thus, hundreds of contradictions mean there are at least hundreds of incorrect statements in the Bible.


### **Christ Lineage Differences**

The[ New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament) provides two accounts of the **genealogy of Jesus**, one in the[ Gospel of Matthew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew) and another in the[ Gospel of Luke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Luke).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_of_Jesus#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Matthew starts with[ Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham), while Luke begins with[ Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam). The lists are identical between Abraham and[ David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David), but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to[ Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph), whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph's father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_of_Jesus#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
