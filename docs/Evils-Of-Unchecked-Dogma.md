## **Central Question:**

Is religious dogma bad?


## **Why this is important to me:**

I grew up believing that there must be only one true church. If it was true, then it was perfect. Sure, maybe not perfect, but it was the thing I could depend on most.

This created a desire and want for dogma. But as I read all of these other sections in this letter I am realizing that dogma can be abused.


### **What is Dogmatic Religion**

Dogmatic religion has a central authority leading everything. The idea is that all communication, ideas, and beliefs come from the central foundational

### **Dogmatic Religion Gives Identity**

"Dogmatic religion stems from a psychological need for group[ identity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/identity) and belonging, together with a need for certainty and meaning. There is a strong impulse in human beings to define ourselves, whether it’s as a Christian, a Muslim, a socialist, an American, a Republican, or as a fan of a sports club. This urge is closely connected to the impulse to be part of a group, to feel that you belong, and share the same beliefs and principles as others. And these impulses work together with the need for certainty—the feeling that you "know," that you possess the truth, that you are right and others are wrong.

At the root of these impulses is a fundamental[ anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety) and sense of lack, caused by our sense of being distinct individuals, existing in separation to other people, and a world "out there." This generates a sense of being "cut off," like fragments that were once part of a whole. There is also a sense of vulnerability and insecurity, caused by our insignificance in the face of the world. As a result, we need to "bolster" our sense of self, to strengthen our identity. And religion, and other belief systems, helps us to do this.


### **Dogmatic Religion's Dangerous In-Out Group Mentality**

Dogmatic religion is dangerous because it creates an in-out group mentality. It encourages people to withdraw[ empathy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/empathy) and[ morality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ethics-and-morality) from other groups, to see them as inferior and ignorant. Other groups can be seen as general entities, rather than as collections of different individuals. And when two groups are thrown together, with their different beliefs clashing, different beliefs that are an affront because they suggest that their own beliefs may be wrong, conflict and warfare are always close at hand."


## **Religious Dogma Causes PTSD Once People Leave**

Dr. Marlene Winell, who refers to herself as a “recovering fundamentalist,” coined the term “religious trauma syndrome” more than a decade ago. It's “the condition **experienced by people who are struggling with leaving an authoritarian, dogmatic religion and coping with the damage of indoctrination**,”

Religious Trauma Syndrome (RTS) is group of symptoms that arise in response to traumatic or stressful religious experiences. While Religious Trauma Syndrome is not an official diagnosis in the DSM-5, it is a common experience shared among many who have escaped cults, fundamentalist religious groups, abusive religious settings, or other painful experiences with religion. The symptoms of Religious Trauma Syndrome are comparable to the symptoms of[ complex PTSD](https://www.restorationcounselingseattle.com/trauma)._

## **Founders of Religious Churches Have Horrible Traits**

Dan and Doug, and Mark from "[How-To Heretic](https://howtoheretic.com/podcast)" studied many religious founders over the course of their podcast. In their final episodes they came to some conclusions about every religion old and new. They were all created by narcissists looking for extreme power. As a side effect, these religious leaders always made their followers perform odd sexual actions. The religions included seperation from the non-believers to assure the leader has as much power as needed. Every single one
