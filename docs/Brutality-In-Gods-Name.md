## **Central Question:**

Why is brutality always associated with the most christian people I know


## **Why this is important to me:**

There is always another reason, but I keep seeing signs of christianity in brutal news articles. It is never directly from a christian group. It is almost like the brutality and the christian values want to pretend they are not together but I keep seeing them together

Christianity is supposed to make people love others more. I should see less christianity in brutal news articles but instead I think that I see more

Why is that. Why is brutality a core tenant to christianity

## **Brutality in the Middle Ages World That was Justified by Christianity**


### **Torture Techniques**

Joseph McCabe’s treatise The History of Torture illustrates the reasoning process. McCabe reports that during the Middle Ages, there was more torture used in Christian Europe than in any society in history.[12]

The main cause of this cruelty was the Christian doctrine of eternal punishment. McCabe explains: “If, it was natural to reason, God punishes men with eternal torment, it is surely lawful for men to use doses of it in a good cause.”[13]

Other historical examples of violent and unjust acts supported by biblical teachings include: the Inquisition; the Crusades; the burning of witches; religious wars; pogroms against Jews; persecution of homosexuals; forceful conversions of heathens; slavery; beatings of children; brutal treatment of the mentally ill; suppression of scientists; and whippings, mutilations, and violent executions of persons convicted of crimes. Those acts were a regular part of the Christian world for centuries.

Thomas Paine was entirely justified in saying about the Bible: “It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it as I detest everything that is cruel.”[14]

## **Holocaust Supported by the German Christian Leaders**

"The vast majority of Germans belonged to a Christian church during the Nazi era. In 1933 there were 40 million Protestants, 20 million Catholics, and small numbers of people adhering to other Christian traditions. The German Evangelical Church (the largest Protestant church) and the Roman Catholic church were pillars of German society and played an important role in shaping people’s attitudes and actions vis-à-vis National Socialism, including anti-communism, nationalism, traditional loyalty to governing authorities (particularly among Protestants), and the convergence of Nazi antisemitism with widespread and deep-seated anti-Jewish prejudice.

Within the German Evangelical Church the pro-Nazi “German Christian” (_Deutsche Christen_) movement emerged in the early 1930s. It attempted to fuse Christianity and National Socialism and promoted a “racially-pure” church by attacking Jewish influences on Christianity."

## **The USA Wars are really Christian Wars**

"Two recent books, Chris Hedges, _War Is a Force that Gives us Meaning_ and Andrew Bacevich, _The New American Militarism_, discuss our nation's love of war and both link it to religion.   "The moral certitude of the state in wartime is a kind of fundamentalism.   And the dangerous messianic brand of religion, one where self-doubt is minimal, has increasingly come to color the modern world of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.(1) Bacevich relates America's new thirst for militarism to the rise of militant evangelicalism's post Vietnam love affair with Israel, reinterpretation of just war of contemporary life.   The result was to give "moral legitimacy" to "military activism."

## **US War Violence done by Christians**

"These are routinely classified as cases of "mental illness" but why is it that this kind of mental illness seems to affect mainly white Christian men born..

What was Timothy McVeigh, the author of the biggest terrorist attack in the USA carried out by a citizen (Oklahoma City, 1995)? A white Anglosaxon Christian.

What about the soldiers who committed atrocities in Vietnam, like William Calley (My Lai massacre, 1968), and Iraq, like the five who gang-raped a little Iraqi girl and then murdered her and her entire family (Mahmudiyah massacre, 2006)? White Christian men. What were the militia members who in 2020 were planning to kidnap and overthrow Michigan's governor Gretchen Whitmer? White Christian men."
