# 1st Person Accounts of Old Testament Stories


## Central Question:
Is every interesting story in the Old Testament just a fable?



## Why this is important to me:

In my mind, to believe in Jesus requires believing the Old Testament. There are many stories that are central to Christianity like the 12 Tribes of Israel, the creation story, and journeys of Moses. Also many of the core Christian tenants are defined in the Old Testament such as the 10 Commandments and tithing

The most important of items established in the Old Testament is the prophecy of a Savior. In my mind it is the key reason to believe in Jesus. He was fulfilling prophecy

## Ancient Manuscript Dating

Dating texts cross-references many techniques to check the results of each. Carbon Dating is one method but not the only method. Experts also look at inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of persons, events, objects, language terms and customs from different time periods

A good example of this is  text handwriting clues such as fonts that did not exist before a time period. The same method is also used for words too. The goal is to narrow down the date by finding features/words that had not been designed before a specific date. 
After a date has been chosen it is peer reviewed for accuracy within their scientific journals


## Every Interesting Old Testament Story Is Like the Game of Telephone
How can I believe any story that was written by 3rd person accounts. In fact, the most interesting Old Testament stories are written supposedly 100's and 1000's of years after they took place. 



## The TOP OLD TESTAMENT Stories Sorted By Years of Heresay Before They Were Written

Looking at this list, the stories written in real time are the boring stories. All of the juicy stories, the stories that Christianity depends on and has built its backbone and basis from are written with hundreds to thousands of years of heresay. 

These stories are literally no different than someone in our time writing about King Authur. Building a religion upon these Old Testament stories back then would be like someone building a religion built around King Authur's Lady of the Lake in this day. How can I trust these Old Testament stories?
